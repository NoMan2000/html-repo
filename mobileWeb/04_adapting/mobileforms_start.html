<h1>HTML5 Form Elements on Mobile Devices</h1>
<p>Some mobile device browsers provide support for HTML5 forms attributes and input types in order
to allow the user to more easily enter certain kinds of data. Phones that use virtual, on-screen keyboards
can provide customized versions of those keyboards that are optimized for those data types, such as email addresses,
URLs, numbers, telephone numbers, etc.</p>
<p>This example file contains form fields for number, email, URL, and tel. </p>
<form action="" method="get">
<p><input type="submit" value="submit" /></p>
</form>
</body>
